  > Graphing Calculator
> * View a number of trigonal functions (sine, cosine, and tangent) or a particular equation that uses these functions using this Python script. You may sketch sine (y = sin(s * x)), cosine (y = cos(c * x)), or tangent (y = tan(t * x)) functions by running the script. If asked, enter the coefficient of the function. This skill allows one to use trigonometric functions, linear terms, and constants in a certain way (e.g., 2 * sin(3 * x) + 3 * x + 5). Plotting the function or equation after your input, the script will also modify the y-axis limits to increase clarity.
