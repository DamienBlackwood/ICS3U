## Works
  > Graphing Calculator
> * View a number of trigonal functions (sine, cosine, and tangent) or a particular equation that uses these functions using this Python script. You may sketch sine (y = sin(s * x)), cosine (y = cos(c * x)), or tangent (y = tan(t * x)) functions by running the script. If asked, enter the coefficient of the function. This skill allows one to use trigonometric functions, linear terms, and constants in a certain way (e.g., 2 * sin(3 * x) + 3 * x + 5). Plotting the function or equation after your input, the script will also modify the y-axis limits to increase clarity.

  > All In One Calculator
> * This program offers images and a number of mathematical operations in a console-based environment. Plotting polynomials and trigonometric functions and determining the places where linear and quadratic equations cross are among the choices available to users. Computed area of different shapes is also made easy by it when combined with the standard mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For graph plotting and mathematical computations, the application makes use of the `matplotlib} and `numpy} libraries. An easy-to-use interface allows for the entering of equations and visualization of the outcomes.
